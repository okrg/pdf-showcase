# PDF Showcase
A PDF preview animator tool.

  * **PDF Processing**: Convert PDF pages into a sequence of image thumbnails.
  * **Animation Generation**: Compile the thumbnails into a single animated GIF or MP4 file with smooth cross-fade transitions between pages.
  * **Dual Interface**:
      * A **CLI** for programmatic/power-user access.
      * A simple **Web UI** for easy drag-and-drop usage.
  * **Configurable Output**: Users must be able to specify the output format, duration, and dimensions.
  * **Temporary File Storage**: Generated files on the web interface are temporary and should be automatically deleted after 24 hours.
